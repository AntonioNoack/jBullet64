# jBullet64

jBullet physics engine
- ported from http://jbullet.advel.cz/
- replaced all floats with doubles
- #Stack.reset()
- replaced Java with Kotlin

Next goals:
- unit-test everything
- replace Javax with JOML/KOML

There might be a bit of renaming, because I prefer to follow the Java naming conventions; and there might be some slight optimizations, if I spot an opportunity.
