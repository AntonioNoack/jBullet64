# jBullet64
jBullet physics engine, ported from http://jbullet.advel.cz/, and replaced all floats with doubles; #Stack.reset()

Next goals:
- unit-test everything
- replace Javax with JOML/KOML
- replace Java with Kotlin

There might be a bit of renaming, because I prefer to follow the Java naming conventions; and there might be some slight optimizations, if I spot an opportunity.
